# Boomer examples

Go to the test project:

```
cd omim-ordo-do
```

Download ontology (too big to check in):

```
make boomer-prepare-ontology
```

Run boomer:

```
make boomer
```

If you want, you can regenerate the ptable as follows, but should not be necessary (checked in):

```
make boomer-prepare-ptable
```
